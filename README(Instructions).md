# SSBBFinal

Place your left hand on WASD and your right on your numpad. If you don't have one, this game won't really work well.

WASD acts like the C-stick, where W is your up smash/air, S is your down smash/air, and A/D are your forward smash/air. 
5123 acts like the movement stick. 

Pressing q before W, A or D will activate a special move. Pressing 5 in mid air will let you double jump.

Kill the sandbag off the top of the screen to win!
